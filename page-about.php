                    You cannot place bets on this site, that is to be done elsewhere (i.e. DraftKings SportsBook, FanDuel SportsBook).
                    This site is to give you a better insight on what the true spreads might be.  We are more accurate than our competitors,
                    and strive to make our clients the most amount of money. <strong class="ds">Drego Sports</strong> is an independently owned 
                    LLC, where we work long hours of the day computing numbers and coming out with the best possible spreads.

                    Even though us here at <strong class="ds">Drego Sports</strong> are giving you the best spreads for your weekly NFL games,
                    we cannot guaruntee that we are going to hit 100% of the time.  That is the reason why we will put on the spread what the 
                    percentage is that we should be right.  We will say <strong class="ds">Eagles | -3 vs. +3 | Redskins --87% </strong>.  Meaning for that
                     game we are 87% confident that we are right.
